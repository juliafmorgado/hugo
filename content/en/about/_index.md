# Hello there! I'm Julia.

Julia started her career as a lawyer in Brazil before moving to the US to study business at UC Berkeley, where she developed a strong interest in strategy and problem-solving. This interest led her to work in marketing, helping businesses refine their messaging and connect with their audiences. In 2022, she made a bold pivot into tech, focusing on cloud technologies and DevOps. Since then, she has been recognized as a [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/?_sft_lf-country=us&_sft_lf-expertise=non-technical&p=julia-furst-morgado), [AWS Container Hero](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/julia-morgado/?did=dh_card&trk=dh_card), [Google Women Techmakers Ambassador](https://developers.google.com/womentechmakers), [Civo Ambassador](https://www.civo.com/ambassadors) and a [Girl Code Ambassador](https://www.girl-code.co.uk/).

Now, as a Global Technologist on the Product Strategy team at Veeam, Julia combines her cross-industry experience to bridge technology and business. She helps organizations adopt cloud-native solutions that enhance resilience, optimize efficiency, and enable scalability. Her expertise lies in translating complex technical concepts into actionable strategies that deliver measurable business outcomes.

Julia is an experienced speaker who has presented on [technical and leadership topics](https://github.com/juliafmorgado/talks) at conferences worldwide in four languages. She also organizes events like the [Kubernetes Community Days NY](https://community.cncf.io/kcd-new-york/), [AWS Community Day New York](https://www.awscommunitynewyork.com/), and [CNCF Midtown Meetup NYC](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-midtown/), bringing together people from diverse backgrounds to exchange ideas, collaborate, and innovate.

From her career journey to her community work, Julia is focused on breaking down barriers. Whether it is making technology more accessible, supporting career transitions, or helping teams solve complex challenges, she thrives at the intersection of technology, business, and people, always striving to create meaningful impact.
