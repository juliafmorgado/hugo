# Hello there! I'm Julia.

![Julia on stage at VeeamOn 2023](https://blog-imgs-23.s3.amazonaws.com/veeamon23.jpeg)

I began my career in Web Development, working across Frontend, Backend, and DevOps, while witnessing the rise of Containers and Cloud Native practices. This journey has given me hands-on learning in areas such as Software Delivery, CI/CD, GitOps, and Platform Engineering.

In recent years, I’ve worked as a global technologist, always focused on empowering customers to build resilience, drive efficiency, and scale effectively. As a [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/?_sft_lf-country=us&_sft_lf-expertise=non-technical&p=julia-furst-morgado), [AWS Container Hero](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/julia-morgado/?did=dh_card&trk=dh_card), [Google Women Techmakers Ambassador](https://developers.google.com/womentechmakers), [Civo Ambassador](https://www.civo.com/ambassadors) and a [Girl Code Ambassador](https://www.girl-code.co.uk/) I’m constantly learning and sharing insights on the latest cloud-native technologies and best practices.

My professional path has been an adventure, spanning law, marketing, and now technology. As a self-made engineer, I blend resilience, adaptability, and a passion for self-learning to make an impact in the tech world.

I’ve spoken on both [technical and leadership topics](https://github.com/juliafmorgado/talks) at conferences worldwide and have significant experience with Open Source projects and communities. I also organize the [KCD NY](https://community.cncf.io/kcd-new-york/), the [Cloud Native Midtown Community Group](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-midtown/) and the [AWS Community Day New York](https://www.awscommunitynewyork.com/)

My philosophy is simple: tech should serve people, not the other way around. Let’s [connect](mailto:contact@juliafmorgado.com) and explore how we can use technology to create meaningful impact, foster innovation, and drive collaboration!
